## Setting up the environment

Follow these instructions to set up our environment.

### 1. Install WPILib and VSCode

If you've never done this, see [Installing WPILib and VSCode](mydoc_install_wpilib_and_vscode).
### 2. Install Git

Of course, it's just as important for the author to write more steps to know what to do next.
