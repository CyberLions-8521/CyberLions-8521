## Installing WPILib and VSCode

WPILib is a library that provides the tools necessary to control your robot. VSCode is a code editor. Follow these instructions to install both.

### 1. Download WPILib

First, download the installer from [WPILib's GitHub](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases). Click on the latest release, then scroll down to the dropdown labeled **assets**. Download the file most applicable to you.

### 2. Write more steps

Of course, it's just as important for the author to write more steps to know what to do next.
